title: Rest 10

## Recap

1 copper piece a day, nay a week is okay, a beggar we saved from the large bully, is our slave.

A city built by Minotaurs,
inhabited by snake people.

We need to get a chart of exploration
to avoid trouble with the Flying Fist patrols.

How seriously are we taking them as a threat.

On a plateau somewhere there's a village with very bad voodoo.


Echec,
seek the wisdom of the ancients,
Uralunga, deep in the jungle
east from Mbala.
he was taken over by this vision.
Then apologized,
a kind of acolyte.
He's curious and would like to follow his vision.


We're searching for the Soul Monger.

## Begin

Between Mount Subaya,
midway between 18 and 19.

Thundering Lizard
and
Kaya's House of Respite/Repost

The sun has set a while ago.
It's raining.
We're itching for rest.

Danny's meeting with the Triceratops people.

The Thundering Lizard is in the city (heavily 'inspired' on the The Blue Water Inn)

"The Thundering  izard" reads the entrance sign.

There are cat-oid people.
And a couple other interesting characters of note.

A Chultan human, sobbing.

Also, leather, armorish type of clothes.
She looks tough. She could whoop ass.
Tougher than our cleric?

Maori type female warrior, black.

We get keys for the two joint bedrooms, and for the common room.

Matt's two peeps from the Thundering Lizard leave, they will be at......somewhere.


I use my rapier to attack.
